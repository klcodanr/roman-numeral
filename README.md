# Roman Numeral Generator

This application takes a number and outputs the corresponding roman numeral.

This implementation is based on the Standard Form as [documented by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Standard_form).

## Limitations

The implementation only supports positive whole numbers between 1-3999. Theoretically larger numbers could be supported by updating the [./src/numerals.json](./src/numerals.json) and [./src/romannumeral.js](./src/romannumeral.js) to map larger values, but this was not in the scope of requirements for this project.
